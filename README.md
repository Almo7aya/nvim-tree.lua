# A simple tree for neovim written in lua

## Notice

- This plugin is under development, it does not yet have all basic functionnalities required by an explorer.
- I am working on this plugin to learn lua, learn neovim api and create a **simple** file explorer with features i need.
- I really don't like any of the vim trees, they are all too complicated for their purposes and are kind of buggy. I have my shell to do most commands.
- This plugin wont work on windows.

## Goals / Features

- [x] moving around the file structure like any basic tree
- [x] open file in current buffer or in split with FzF like bindings (CR, C-v, C-x)
- [x] icons for files
- [ ] add / delete file in directory
- [ ] quickly find file in the directory structure
- [ ] syntax highlighting
- [ ] simple git integration (color of file changing when staged/changed)
