# A simple tree for neovim written in lua

## Notice

This is under development, do not try to use it right now. The best you could do is wait or give me tips to work better with lua.

I am working on this plugin to learn lua, learn neovim api and create a **simple** file explorer with features i need.

I really don't like any of the vim trees, they are all too complicated for their purpose. I do have my shell to do most commands.

## Goals / Features

### 0.1
- [ ] moving around the file structure like any basic tree
- [x] open file in current buffer or in split with FzF like bindings (CR, C-v, C-x)

### 0.2
- [ ] add / delete file in directory
- [ ] quickly find file in the directory structure

### 0.3
- [ ] icons for files
- [ ] simple git integration (color of file changing when staged/changed)
