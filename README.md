# A simple tree for neovim written in lua

## Notice

This is under development, do not try to use it, it does not work.

I am working on this plugin to learn lua, become better with neovim api and create a **simple** file explorer with features i need.

I really don't like any of the vim trees, they are all too complicated for their purpose. I do have my shell to do most commands.


## Goals / Features

- [] moving around the file structure like any basic tree
- [] open file in current buffer or in split with FzF like bindings (CR, C-v, C-x)
- [] add / delete file in directory
- [] quickly find file in the directory structure
- [] icons for files
- [] simple git integration (color of file changing when staged/changed)
